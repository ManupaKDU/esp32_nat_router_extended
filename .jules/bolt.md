## 2024-05-14 - [O(n^2) String Concatenation Bottleneck]
**Learning:** Using `strcat` inside a loop requires scanning the entire destination string to find the NUL terminator on every iteration, resulting in O(n^2) performance. Furthermore, performing small, repeated memory allocations (`malloc`/`free`) inside the loop creates unnecessary heap fragmentation and latency.
**Action:** When building strings iteratively, use the return value of `sprintf`/`snprintf` to advance a pointer directly to the end of the buffer (`ptr += len`), avoiding both `strcat` and redundant memory allocations.
